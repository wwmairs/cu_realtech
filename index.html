				<p>Our Mission
					 
					 “Our mission is to prepare students to add
					 immediate and long-term value to the real estate
					 sector by teaching “where the industry is
					 headed”, with a particular emphasis on
					 identifying the roles of, and opportunities from,
					 advances in all forms of technology.”
					 
					 The CU Real Estate Center of the Leeds
					 School of Business aspires to be the
					 nation’s leading center of education,
					 knowledge and engagement for the real
					 estate profession.Real estate, as a factor of
					 production and a major financial investment
					 asset, is one of the sectors most impacted
					 by technology. In spite of this, real estate
					 has been one of the slowest business
					 sectors and areas of professional study to
					 get their arms and heads around these
					 changes.
					 
					 The powerful connections between the
					 academic and business communities, which
					 define the CU Real Estate Center, position
					 the Leeds School of Business to quickly
					 and dynamically embrace the opportunities
					 from studying the interrelated relationships
					 between technological change and real
					 estate while simultaneously tackling the
					 challenges arising from this accelerating
					 evolution.
